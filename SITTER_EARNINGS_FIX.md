# 🔧 Sitter Earnings Fix - Active Bookings Issue

## ✅ **Root Cause Identified**

The issue was that the sitter earnings calculation was only looking for bookings with `status === 'completed'`, but the actual bookings in the database have `status === 'active'`. Since `active` bookings are the ones that have been paid for, they should be included in the earnings calculation.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

### 1. **Updated Booking Interface** ✅
- Added `'active'` to the valid booking status types
- Changed from: `'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled' | 'completed'`
- Changed to: `'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled' | 'completed' | 'active'`

### 2. **Fixed getCompletedSitterBookings()** ✅
- Now includes both `'completed'` and `'active'` bookings
- Since `active` bookings are paid, they should count as earnings

### 3. **Fixed dashboardService.ts** ✅
- Updated `getSitterMetrics()` to include `active` bookings in earnings calculation
- Updated job count to include both `completed` and `active` bookings

## 📊 **Backend Data Confirmed**

**Sitter 120 (glo riaaaa) has:**
- ✅ **4 active bookings** (₱3,000.00 each = ₱12,000.00 total)
- ✅ **Wallet balance**: ₱10,800.00 (90% of ₱12,000.00)
- ✅ **1 pending booking** (not yet paid)

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

### **Pet Sitter Dashboard should now show:**
- ✅ **Total Income**: ₱10,800.00 (90% of ₱12,000.00 from 4 active bookings)
- ✅ **Jobs Completed**: 4 (active bookings count as completed/paid)
- ✅ **This Week**: ₱10,800.00 (if bookings were created this week)
- ✅ **Upcoming Jobs**: 1 (the pending booking)

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// Only looked for 'completed' bookings
return sitterBookings.filter(b => b.status === 'completed');
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Include both 'completed' and 'active' bookings since active bookings are paid
return sitterBookings.filter(b => b.status === 'completed' || b.status === 'active');
```

## 🧪 **How to Test**

1. **Open the Pet Sitter Dashboard** (you're logged in as User 120)
2. **Pull down to refresh** the dashboard
3. **You should now see**:
   - Total Income: ₱10,800.00
   - Jobs Completed: 4
   - This Week: ₱10,800.00 (or appropriate amount based on booking dates)

## 🎯 **Why This Should Work**

1. **Backend Data is Correct**: 4 active bookings worth ₱12,000.00 total
2. **Wallet Balance is Correct**: ₱10,800.00 (90% of total)
3. **API Calls are Working**: Status 200 responses confirmed
4. **Earnings Calculation is Fixed**: Now includes active bookings
5. **TypeScript Interface is Updated**: Includes 'active' status

The sitter dashboard should now display the correct earnings from the 4 active (paid) bookings! 🎉
