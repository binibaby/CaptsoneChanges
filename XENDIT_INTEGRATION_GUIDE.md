# Xendit Payment Integration Guide

This guide covers the complete Xendit Sandbox integration for the Pet Sitting App, including payment processing, E-Wallet functionality, and real-time updates.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The integration consists of:

### Backend (Laravel)
- **XenditService**: Handles Xendit API calls for invoices and disbursements
- **PaymentController**: Manages payment creation and webhook handling
- **WalletController**: Handles E-Wallet operations and cash out
- **Events**: Laravel Reverb events for real-time updates
- **Models**: Updated User model with wallet_balance field

### Frontend (React Native)
- **BookingSummaryScreen**: Shows booking details before payment
- **XenditCheckoutScreen**: Handles Xendit payment redirect
- **EWalletScreen**: Displays wallet balance and transaction history
- **PaymentService**: Frontend API service for payment operations
- **RealtimeService**: WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- **DashboardService**: Manages dashboard metrics with real-time updates

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Configuration

#### Environment Variables

REVERB_SCHEME=http
```

#### Database Migration

2. Clicks "Book Now" ‚Üí redirects to `BookingSummaryScreen`
3. Shows booking details and total amount
4. User clicks "Proceed to Payment"

### 2. Payment Processing
1. Frontend calls `/api/payments/create-invoice`

3. User redirected to Xendit Sandbox checkout page
4. After payment, Xendit sends webhook to `/api/webhooks/xendit/payment`

### 3. Payment Completion
1. Webhook handler processes payment
2. Updates booking status to "active"
3. Adds money to sitter's wallet (90% of total)
4. Broadcasts `PaymentReceived` and `WalletUpdated` events
5. Real-time updates sent to both owner and sitter dashboards
