# ðŸ”„ Pull-to-Refresh Implemented for Pet Owner Dashboard

## âœ… What's Been Added

### 1. **Pull-to-Refresh Functionality** âœ…
- **Import**: Added `RefreshControl` and `ActivityIndicator` from React Native
- **State Management**: Added `refreshing` state to track refresh status
- **Dynamic Data**: Converted static data to dynamic state variables

### 2. **Dynamic Data Loading** âœ…
- **Real-time Data**: Dashboard now fetches live data from API
- **Bookings Data**: Loads user's bookings and filters by status
- **Payments Data**: Loads payment history and calculates totals
- **Statistics**: Calculates total spent, active bookings, and weekly spending

### 3. **Refresh Control Integration** âœ…
- **ScrollView Enhancement**: Added `RefreshControl` to the main ScrollView
- **Visual Feedback**: Custom colors matching the app theme
- **Loading Indicator**: Small spinner in header during refresh
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both iOS and Android

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### **Pull-to-Refresh Flow:**
1. **User pulls down** on the dashboard
2. **RefreshControl triggers** the `onRefresh` function
3. **Data is fetched** from the API endpoints:
   - `/bookings` - Gets user's bookings
   - `/payments/history` - Gets payment history
4. **Statistics are calculated**:
   - Total spent from completed payments
   - Active bookings count
   - This week's spending
5. **UI updates** with fresh data
6. **Refresh indicator disappears**

### **Auto-refresh on Focus:**
- Dashboard automatically refreshes when user navigates back to it
- Ensures data is always up-to-date

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

### **Bookings API** (`/bookings`)
- Fetches all user bookings
- Filters for active/confirmed bookings
- Counts upcoming bookings

### **Payments API** (`/payments/history`)
- Fetches payment history
- Calculates total spent from completed payments
- Calculates weekly spending from recent payments

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features

### **Refresh Control Styling:**
```typescript
<RefreshControl
  refreshing={refreshing}
  onRefresh={onRefresh}
  colors={['#10B981', '#8B5CF6', '#F97316']} // Android
  tintColor="#10B981" // iOS
  title="Refreshing dashboard..." // iOS
  titleColor="#666" // iOS
/>
```

### **Loading Indicator:**
- Small spinner appears next to "Pet Owner Dashboard" title
- Only shows during refresh
- Matches app's green theme color

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **State Variables Added:**
```typescript
const [refreshing, setRefreshing] = useState<boolean>(false);
const [upcomingBookings, setUpcomingBookings] = useState<Booking[]>([]);
const [ownerStats, setOwnerStats] = useState({
  totalSpent: 'â‚±0',
  activeBookings: 0,
  thisWeek: 'â‚±0',
});
```

### **Key Functions:**
- `loadDashboardData()` - Fetches and processes all dashboard data
- `onRefresh()` - Handles pull-to-refresh action
- `useFocusEffect()` - Auto-refreshes when screen comes into focus

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### **Manual Refresh:**
1. Open the Pet Owner Dashboard
2. **Pull down** on the screen
3. Watch the refresh indicator appear
4. See the data update with fresh information

### **Auto-refresh:**
1. Navigate away from the dashboard
2. Complete a payment or booking
3. Navigate back to the dashboard
4. Data should automatically refresh
